# FIFA-Analysis
This project delves deep into the world of football analytics, examining key player attributes to uncover what drives performance and market value in the professional football landscape.

#**Goals:**
Predicting overall performance ratings from key attributes. 
Classifying players into their club positions based on performance metrics.
Examining the relationship between age and pace.
Forecasting market value using player statistics and attributes.

#**Business Questions answered:**
1. Predict the Overall Performance Rating of football players based on key performance attributes.
   > Method used: Predictive Modeling with multiple regression
2. Classify a player as Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder or Forward based on their individual performance attributes such as pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, physic, overall, potential.
   > Method used: Predictive Modeling with Classification using BAGGED KKN
3. Test, whether a player's age affect their average pace (a combination of acceleration and sprint speed).
   > Hypothesis Testing using Wilcoxon rank sum test
4. Predict a player's market value based on attributes such as age, overall rating, potential, and specific skill attributes (passing, dribbling, shooting) and other variables.
   > Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression
